## 📈 Learning Philosophy

**"Build in Public, Learn by Doing, Solve Real Problems"**

Every concept I learn gets implemented from scratch. Every project connects to real business value. Every milestone is documented and shared to help others on their AI journey.

### **Current Focus Areas:**
1. **Mathematical Intuition** - Understanding the "why" behind every algorithm
2. **Practical Implementation** - Coding everything from scratch before using libraries  
3. **Business Application** - Connecting technical skills to revenue opportunities
4. **Knowledge Sharing** - Teaching others while learning myself
